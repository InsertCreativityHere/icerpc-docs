Slice consists of several components:
- the Slice language\
The Slice language is purely about defining RPCs and types such as structs and enums used by these RPCs. It's a simple
language without any execution logic: no if, no while, no print. This kind of language is called an
[Interface Definition Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_description_language) or IDL.

- the Slice encoding\
The Slice encoding specifies how Slice IDL constructs such as string, int32, double, struct and operation parameters are
encoded into streams of bytes. The Slice encoding is simple, compact binary encoding. For instance, it specifies that a
Slice `int32` (a signed 32-bit integer) is encoded using two's complement into 4 bytes in little endian order. Most
Slice users don't need to know the details of this encoding.

- Slice language mappings\
Slice provides support for "real" programming languages such as C# or Python through language mappings (also known as
language bindings). A language mapping is a set of rules that specifies how Slice IDL constructs are represented in that
language. For instance, a Slice IDL struct is mapped to a struct in C#. The C# language mapping specifies the name of
this struct, its fields, its constructors etc.

- Slice compiler\
Each Slice language mapping is supported by a tool--a Slice compiler--that generates code from the Slice IDL definitions
to the mapped language. In C#, the Slice to C# compiler, `slicec-cs`, compiles .slice files into .cs files. If a Slice
file defines a struct, the corresponding .cs file contains the mapped C# struct.

- Slice library code\
Each Slice language mapping is partially implemented by library code in the target language. For example, the Slice to
C# mapping relies on `SliceEncoder` and `SliceDecoder`, two C# structs defined in namespace `IceRpc.Slice` that can
encode resp. decode a variety of types to or from byte buffers. These structs are included in the IceRpc assembly and
referenced by the code generated by the Slice to C# compiler.

These components work together to help you make RPCs without having to worry about encoding intricacies. Your primary
responsibility is to use the same Slice IDL definitions in your client and server applications; the Slice library code
and the code generated by the Slice compiler implement the Slice encoding and take care of all the encoding/decoding
details.
