Slice consists of several components:
- the Slice language\
Slice-the-language is purely about defining RPCs. It's a simple language without any execution logic: no if, no while,
no print. This type of language is called an
[Interface Definition Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_description_language) or IDL.

- the Slice encoding\
The Slice encoding specifies how Slice IDL constructs such as string, int32, double, struct, operation parameters and
more are encoded into streams of bytes. The Slice encoding is a binary encoding. As an example, it specifies that a
Slice int32 (a signed 32-bit integer) is encoded using two's complement into 4 bytes in little endian order. Most Slice
users don't need to know the details of this encoding.

- Slice language mappings\
Slice provides support for "real" programming languages such as C# or Python through language mappings (also known as
language bindings). A language mapping specifies how Slice IDL constructs are represented in that language. For example,
a Slice IDL interface is mapped to two interfaces and one struct in C#.

- Slice compiler\
Each Slice language mapping is supported by a tool--a Slice compiler--that generates code from the Slice IDL definitions
to the mapped language. For example, the Slice to C# compiler, `slicec-cs`, compiles .slice files into .cs files.

- Slice library code\
Each Slice language mapping is partially implemented by library code in the target language. For example, the Slice to
C# mapping relies on `SliceEncoder` and `SliceDecoder`, two C# structs defined in namespace `IceRpc.Slice` that can
encode resp. decode a variety of types to or from byte buffers. These structs are included in the IceRpc assembly and
referenced by the code generated by the Slice to C# compiler.

These components work together to help you make RPCs easily without having to worry about encoding intricacies. Your
primary responsibility is to use the same Slice IDL definitions in your client and server applications; the Slice
compiler and Slice library code implement the Slice encoding and take care of all the encoding/decoding details.
